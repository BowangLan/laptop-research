                <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quiz: Provide a short quiz to give recommendations to users who might not 
                            initially know what kind of laptop they want.</li>
                        <li>Filtering: Allow users to check off different preferences they have, like 
                            the minimum amount of storage they need their laptop to have, to help them 
                            narrow down search results.</li>
                        <li>Compare tool: Allow users to compare similar laptops.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>App Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Our app would be a solution because it would initially provide laptop recommendations 
                    based off of the quiz the user fills out. From there, the user is able to adjust different 
                    filters to easily find a laptop that suits their needs. Once the user has found a few laptops 
                    that meet their needs, they can then use our compare tool to compare these options and make 
                    their final selection. In the end, our app will allow users to quickly and easily find a 
                    laptop with their preferred specs.
